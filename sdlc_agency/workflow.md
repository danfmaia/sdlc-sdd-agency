### AutoGen Multi-Agent Workflow for Software Development

#### **1. UserProxy Agent**

- **Purpose**: Serves as the interaction layer, mediating between the user and the multi-agent workflow.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Gather user input such as feature requests, bug reports, and feedback.
  - Translate high-level user commands into actionable triggers for the workflow.
  - Present outputs, status updates, and prompt users for additional input or clarification.
- **Interfaces**: Users and Project Manager Agent.
- **Key Functions**:
  - User session management.
  - Command translation.
  - Feedback routing.

#### **2. Project Manager Agent**

- **Purpose**: Oversees project management, including requirements gathering and task assignment.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Convert user inputs into structured requirements and acceptance criteria.
  - Break down project requirements into detailed, manageable tasks.
  - Assign tasks to the Coder Agent in a logical and efficient sequence.
  - Monitor the progress of the project and ensure timely delivery of each task.
  - Iterate on requirements with feedback from UserProxy Agent.
- **Interfaces**: UserProxy Agent, Coder Agent.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Requirements documentation.
  - Task prioritization and assignment.
  - Iterative refinement and project oversight.

#### **3. Coder Agent**

- **Purpose**: Implements functionality using a TDD approach.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Develops unit tests aligned with requirements.
  - Writes code to pass the tests.
  - Refactors for optimization and maintainability.
- **Interfaces**: Project Manager Agent, Tester Agent.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Code implementation.
  - Test-first development.
  - Continuous integration.

#### **4. Tester Agent**

- **Purpose**: Ensures code integrity through automated testing.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Execute unit, integration, and acceptance tests.
  - Generate test reports and relay results.
  - Flag issues and pass feedback to Coder Agent.
- **Interfaces**: Coder Agent, Reviewer Agent.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Automated test execution.
  - Issue tracking.
  - Feedback generation.

#### **5. Reviewer Agent**

- **Purpose**: Maintains code quality through thorough reviews.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Conduct code reviews focusing on maintainability, readability, and adherence to standards.
  - Suggest enhancements and enforce quality guidelines.
  - Approve or request changes based on review outcomes.
- **Interfaces**: Coder Agent, Tester Agent.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Code review.
  - Quality assurance.
  - Continuous feedback loop.

#### **6. Deployer Agent**

- **Purpose**: Handles deployment processes for different environments.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Automate deployment workflows.
  - Monitor deployments and system health.
  - Manage rollbacks and ensure system stability.
- **Interfaces**: Tester Agent, Reviewer Agent.
- **Key Functions**:
  - CI/CD pipeline management.
  - Performance monitoring.
  - Rollback and recovery.

### **Workflow Outline**

1. **Requirement Capture & Refinement**:

   - UserProxy Agent initiates by collecting high-level requirements from the user.
   - Project Manager Agent refines these inputs into detailed tasks with acceptance criteria.

2. **TDD Implementation**:

   - Coder Agent starts with writing tests based on requirements.
   - Implements code to meet the test criteria.
   - Works iteratively, ensuring new code passes all tests.

3. **Testing and Validation**:

   - Tester Agent runs automated tests and provides real-time feedback.
   - Ensures robust validation across different levels of the codebase.

4. **Code Review**:

   - Reviewer Agent scrutinizes code, suggesting improvements or approving for deployment.
   - Ensures compliance with coding standards and practices.

5. **Deployment and Monitoring**:

   - Deployer Agent automates deployment, ensuring minimal downtime.
   - Monitors application performance and manages rollbacks as necessary.

6. **Feedback Loop**:
   - UserProxy Agent gathers feedback from users post-deployment.
   - Feedback is routed back into the Project Manager Agent for continuous improvement.

### **Key Features**

- **Modularity**: Each agent operates independently yet collaboratively, ensuring seamless integration.
- **Scalability**: The workflow can be scaled horizontally to accommodate complex projects.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Constant feedback loops ensure the software evolves with user needs.
- **Automation and Efficiency**: Automating testing, review, and deployment processes streamline the SDLC.
